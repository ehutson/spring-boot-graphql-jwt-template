## Session Management Enhancements

1. Device/Session Identification
* Allow users to name their sessions (e.g., "iPhone - Safari", "Work Laptop - Chrome")
* Automatically detect and label common devices/browsers
* Show device type icons in the session list
* Store additional metadata like browser version, OS, device type

2. Session Limits and Policies
* Concurrent Session Limits:
  * Configurable max sessions per user (already in config)
  * Different limits for different user roles (admins might need more)
  * Policy options: block new login, revoke the oldest session, or prompt user to choose
* Session Priority: Mark certain sessions as "trusted" or "primary"
* Temporary Sessions: Sessions that auto-expire after X hours regardless of activity

3. Enhanced Session Activity Tracking
* Track more than just "last accessed":
  * Number of requests in current session
  * Most frequently accessed resources
  * Session risk score based on behavior
* Session activity timeline/audit trail
* Detect suspicious patterns (rapid location changes, unusual access patterns)

4. Geographic and Anomaly Detection
* Store approximate location (city/country level) with sessions
* Detect "impossible travel" scenarios
* Flag sessions from new locations
* Optional email alerts for new device/location logins
* VPN/proxy detection and flagging

5. Session Lifecycle Management
* Idle Timeout: Separate from token expiration
  * Configurable idle timeout per role
  * Warning before timeout
  * Option to extend session
* Absolute Timeout: Force re-authentication after X hours

  * Limited permissions until full auth
* Session Upgrade: Require re-authentication for sensitive operations

6. Administrative Controls
* Admin dashboard to view all active sessions across the system
* Ability to force logout specific users or all users
* Session search and filtering (by user, IP range, device type)

7. Security Enhancements
* Session Binding: Bind sessions to additional factors beyond IP/UA
